# Copy this file to .env.local and add your Google Maps API key.
# Do NOT commit your real key to source control.

# Example:
# VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY=AIza...your_key_here

# After creating .env.local, restart the dev server (Vite) so the env var is picked up.
# Restrict the API key in Google Cloud Console to your allowed referrers (e.g. http://localhost:5174)
